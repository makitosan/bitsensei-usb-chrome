A Chrome extension is NOT :cry: able to access chrome.usb. Permission "usb" is not granted to a Chrome extension. This is a proof of concept failure... shamed... When you try to install a extension which has permissions "usb" in manifest.json, Chrome shows an error message `'usb' is only allowed for packaged apps, but this is a extension.`
